Artemis Finance was the project's client. They are a financial consulting firm that assists people in creating customized financial plans. They create a wide variety of financial plans. Artemis Financial wants to use more technologies and update their operations. To keep their company safe, they are working to strengthen security and add extra safeguards.

I think I did a great job integrating the OWASP Dependency check tool. I think I've gotten the hang of utilizing this tool now, and I can use and apply this code correctly—it was done well in this report. Building code securely is essential, mainly for user or customer safety. It is necessary to protect their safety and privacy, and this needs to be done appropriately. Furthermore, the company's reputation among customers will be severely damaged.

The hardest part, in my opinion, was creating the self-certificate. I still don't fully understand it, and there are certain parts that seem a little unclear. I'm confident that with practice and patience, I'll improve. Additionally, I think I still have a lot to learn about credentials in general.

By using the OWASP Dependency check tool, creating a self-generated self-certificate, and constructing a hash function cipher, I was able to enhance security layers. All of this added to the system's overall strength and provided a special perspective.

I used a few testing techniques to make sure my code was secure and workable. I did a lot of manual testing, analyzed my code, and linked the docs to make sure the reasoning made sense, and everything was consistent. To make sure the code was operating correctly, I used the system's automated testing tool. To see if there were any new vulnerabilities, I then used the OWASP Dependency check program again and examined the updated report.

I have been introduced to numerous new tools. I've never implemented hashing functions at a level comparable to this project, used the self-generated certification, or utilized the OWASP Dependency Check tool. I'm happy to have these tools in my toolkit since I can see them being incredibly beneficial in certain circumstances.

I would like to demonstrate to potential employers the features and tools I successfully integrated for this project. I want to demonstrate to them that I'm not completely new to these tools—I've used them previously.
